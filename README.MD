This mod was specifically made to let cobblestone generators automatically generate ores from the Ore Pool,
with the tag forge:ores. If you want to customise what your generator generators, there are many mods available.

This mod is just experimental and used for private purposes. You can compile it yourself with these instructions:
git clone https://github.com/SpiralSky/Ore-Generators.git
cd ./Ore-Generators
./gradlew build
The generated file should be in build/libs/

If you find any issues open one in github. Please note that bugs may not be fixed as this mod was just created for private purposes.
